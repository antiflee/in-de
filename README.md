This project is about getting public involved in shipping packages to improve convenience and service
* Today's shipping is expensive and hard to track missing/delayed packages. Its also not environment friendly as special purpose vehicles deliver packages to you
* There may be a person nearby who is going to the destination you want to send the package to and could deliver it for you.
* By involving public, we can reduce the cost of the transport, improve service and help environment Which is what Special Delivery project is set out to achieve! Please join us and help make world a better place to live!!
