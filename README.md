This project is about getting public involved in shipping packages to improve convenience and service
* Today's shipping is special purpose and hard to track missing/delayed packages. Its also not environment friendly as special purpose vehicles deliver packages to you
* There may be person nearby who is going to the destination you want to send the package to and could deliver it for you.
* By involving public, we can reduce the cost of the transport, improve service and help environment!
